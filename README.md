# Image-Reconstruction-using-Convolutional-Autoencoders-in-PyTorch
I designed a Convolutional Autoencoder using PyTorch to compress and reconstruct MNIST dataset images. The Encoder and Decoder architecture, along with Adam optimization and BCE loss, facilitated image compression. The trained Autoencoder achieved successful image reconstruction through 30 epochs of training.
